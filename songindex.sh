# Music Song Database Management Script
# Description:
# This script is designed to manage a simple music song database using bash scripting. The database allows users to:
# 1. Add new song records (including artist name, song title, genre, BPM, and Camelot key).
# 2. Search for songs by various attributes (artist, title, genre).
# 3. Remove songs from the database by specifying the title.
# 4. Generate reports to view all songs or filter by genre.
# 5. Provide a user-friendly menu to interact with these features.
# The script uses a text file to store the data, ensuring it is lightweight and easy to use for a basic cataloging system.
